## Problem Statement
Manage Productivity and Engagement for Work

## Project Type
- [x] Standard Project

## Scope
This project is meant to help me with understanding how I am able to manage my work overall. 
- First, I am an DevOps Specialist apprentice at a trading firm. I have access to a macbook 24/7 where I go most of my work.
- I have a manager that is taking on the role as our main instructor, taking us through most of the tech stack/workflows we'll be using on the job, but 
a lot of this is like very general in a sense, where we're like a developing "egg" where we are able to find our focus area and what team we would be a good
fit on during our next rotation. 
- We also have coaches assigned to each of us to further explore anything that we are learning. They also give their input into what they observe when
working with us in the time that they can. 
- We've been learning a lot about many different technologies and tools, but there has not been any real direction (believe this is part of the egg thing.)
We will be on a dedictated team in our next rotation so this will definitely be different.
- I have 6 other members of the cohort that I have developed some good relationships with, but I feel like I can really be better in engaging with my fellow apprentices.
- That said, I think it all comes down to me not knowing how to speak intelligently and act swiftly to handling priorities and getting the most out of my opportunities here:
---- I would like to maximize my time with my managers, coaches, teams, and even the optional Slack channels and communities that I'm interested in. 
- After the next rotation is where we have a high chance of being hired, but I want to be a great candidate regardless and get ahead by devloping strong
habits and workflows now. This especially includes dealing with calendars, engagement, current projects (there is a lot lol), organization, etc.
- I would like to emphasize that there may be large gaps in my knowledge on these matters, and I'm sure there are question I'm not even sure to ask.
