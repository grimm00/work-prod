## 💡 Integration Opportunities

### How Productivity App Could Help

**Project Tracking:**
- [ ] Link tasks to specific projects/repos?
- [ ] See which projects are active/inactive?
- [ ] Track time per project?
- [ ] Quick project switcher?

**Learning Integration:**
- [ ] Link learning journal entries to projects in ~/Learning?
- [ ] Track what you learned while building what?
- [ ] Skills gained from specific projects?

**GitHub Integration:**
- [ ] Pull commit history for work tracking?
- [ ] See activity across repos?
- [ ] Link tasks to issues/PRs?
- [ ] Track contributions to different projects?

**Context Preservation:**
- [ ] Save "what I was doing" notes per project?
- [ ] Quick context switch with saved state?
- [ ] Link meetings/learnings to projects?

---

### Potential Features to Consider

**8th Core Feature: Projects & Repository Tracker?**
- Track all projects (work, personal, learning)
- Link projects to organizations (DRW, Apprenti)
- Mark projects as active/inactive/archived
- Link tasks, learnings, skills to projects
- GitHub integration for commit tracking
- Time tracking per project
- Quick project context switching

**Other Ideas:**
- Daily focus could show: "Continue work on [project X]"
- Skills matrix could show: "Used Python in [these projects]"
- Learning journal: "While building [project], learned [thing]"
- Weekly review: "This week focused on [projects]"
