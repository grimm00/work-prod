## 🎯 Overview

The exploration directory contains research and requirements gathering documents that inform feature planning and implementation decisions. This phase focuses on understanding user needs, evaluating options, and establishing clear specifications before development begins.

### Exploration Philosophy

1. **User-Centric** - Start with real user needs and pain points
2. **Evidence-Based** - Document current state before designing solutions
3. **Option Analysis** - Evaluate alternatives with clear criteria
4. **Iterative** - Exploration can continue alongside development
5. **Decision Documentation** - Clear rationale for choices made
