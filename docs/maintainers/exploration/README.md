## 🎯 Overview

The exploration directory contains research and requirements gathering documents that inform feature planning and implementation decisions. This phase focuses on understanding user needs, evaluating options, and establishing clear specifications before development begins.

### Exploration Philosophy

1. **User-Centric** - Start with real user needs and pain points
2. **Evidence-Based** - Document current state before designing solutions
3. **Option Analysis** - Evaluate alternatives with clear criteria
4. **Iterative** - Exploration can continue alongside development
5. **Decision Documentation** - Clear rationale for choices made

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed Exploration

- Initial project scope definition
- User context gathering
- Scope clarification questionnaire (user responses complete)
- Project inventory POC (59 unique projects, 24 languages discovered)

### 🟠 In Progress

- Requirements documentation
- Feature prioritization refinement

### 🟡 Scheduled

- **Project Inventory System Refactoring (Week 4)** - POC works and delivered data, but has technical debt. Full research and ADR-0005 scheduled for Week 4 alongside other medium priority topics. See [POC Analysis](../research/automation/inventory-system-poc-analysis.md).

### 🟡 Planned Exploration

- Research register execution (Week 1-4 topics)
- Technology stack research (Flask, React, SQLite)
- Microsoft ecosystem and Miro integration research
- Data model design (all core features)
- Workflow design
- Integration analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Complete scope clarification questionnaire~~
2. ✅ ~~Create research register with topics~~
3. ✅ ~~Complete Week 1 critical research (Flask, React, SQLite, integration)~~
4. ✅ ~~Complete project inventory POC~~
5. **CURRENT:** Begin Week 2 HIGH priority research (Microsoft Graph, M365, Data Models)
6. Execute Weeks 3-4 research (Additional Models, UI, Polish)
7. Week 4: Research and refactor inventory system (ADR-0005)
8. Create first feature plan based on requirements and research
