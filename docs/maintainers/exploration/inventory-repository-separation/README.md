## 🎯 Overview

This exploration goes deeper into the inventory repository separation to identify specific research questions, evaluate options, and prepare for implementation. The high-level decision has been made (separate repository recommended), but several questions remain about:

- Repository naming and structure
- Git history preservation strategies
- Script organization patterns
- Configuration management approaches
- Integration patterns with work-prod
- Technical debt prioritization

## 📊 Status

**Current Phase:** Exploration  
**Prior Work:** Phase 1 of transition plan complete (documentation)  
**Next Step:** Conduct research on topics identified in research-topics.md
