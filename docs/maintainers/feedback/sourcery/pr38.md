## Overall Comments

- The README now documents `PROJ_API_URL` without the `/api` suffix while other parts of the docs still talk about the API under `/api`; consider standardizing the documented base URL so CLI config examples and API path descriptions are consistent.
- All installation examples for `proj-cli` use an unpinned `git+https` URL; consider referencing a tagged version (or PyPI package if/when available) to improve reproducibility and avoid unexpected breaking changes for users following the README.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 (API URL consistency) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Documentation clarity, can defer |
| #2 (Version pinning) | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Good practice, defer until PyPI publish |

**Assessment:** No blocking issues. Both comments are documentation improvements that can be addressed in a future PR.
