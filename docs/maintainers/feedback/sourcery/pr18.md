## Overall Comments

- For consistency of missing-value handling, consider aligning the `Path` column’s `[dim]No path[/dim]` placeholder with the new `'N/A'` values (either use a similar dim style for status/org/classification or standardize on a single representation).
- The `wide` flag currently drives both additional columns and wrapping behavior; if you anticipate more view modes in the future, you might factor column configuration into a small helper (e.g., `build_table(wide: bool)`) to keep the command function focused on data retrieval and orchestration.
- You may want to slightly expand the `--wide` flag help text (e.g., mention that it uses extra columns and full-width layout) so that users understand it affects both which columns are shown and how they are displayed.
