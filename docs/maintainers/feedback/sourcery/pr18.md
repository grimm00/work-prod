## Overall Comments

### Comment #1: Consistency of Missing-Value Handling

**Description:** For consistency of missing-value handling, consider aligning the `Path` column's `[dim]No path[/dim]` placeholder with the new `'N/A'` values (either use a similar dim style for status/org/classification or standardize on a single representation).

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW | **Impact:** 🟢 LOW | **Effort:** 🟢 LOW

**Assessment:** Minor consistency improvement. Current implementation works fine, but standardizing on one representation would improve code consistency. Can be deferred.

**Action:** Defer to future PR

### Comment #2: Factor Column Configuration into Helper

**Description:** The `wide` flag currently drives both additional columns and wrapping behavior; if you anticipate more view modes in the future, you might factor column configuration into a small helper (e.g., `build_table(wide: bool)`) to keep the command function focused on data retrieval and orchestration.

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Effort:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Assessment:** Good refactoring suggestion for maintainability. However, current implementation is simple and clear. This would be valuable if we add more view modes in the future, but premature optimization for now.

**Action:** Defer to future PR (when adding more view modes)

### Comment #3: Expand --wide Flag Help Text

**Description:** You may want to slightly expand the `--wide` flag help text (e.g., mention that it uses extra columns and full-width layout) so that users understand it affects both which columns are shown and how they are displayed.

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW | **Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Effort:** 🟢 LOW

**Assessment:** Good UX improvement. Current help text is brief but could be more descriptive. Quick fix that improves user understanding.

**Action:** Quick fix - can be done now or deferred
