### Comment #1

**Location**: `scripts/project_cli/error_handler.py:196`

**Type**: suggestion (bug_risk)

**Description**: If the goal is to treat network/HTTP failures as `False`, catching all `Exception` will also hide unrelated bugs (e.g., wrong `base_url` type or other programming errors). Catch a narrower type like `requests.RequestException` so only request-related failures are converted to `False` and real coding errors still surface.

<summary>Details</summary>

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
         response = requests.get(health_url, timeout=2)
         return response.status_code == 200
-    except:
+    except Exception:
         return False
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**suggestion (bug_risk):** Catching broad `Exception` may hide non-network errors; consider limiting to request-related exceptions.

## Overall Comments

- In `check_backend_health`, now that you’ve moved away from a bare `except`, consider narrowing the exception type further to `requests.RequestException` (or similar) so that unexpected programming errors don’t get silently swallowed as simple health-check failures.
- For `get_max_rows`, you might want to emit a debug log when falling back to the default on invalid config values so that misconfigurations are visible rather than silently ignored.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

Use this template to assess each comment:

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Bug risk: Catching broad Exception may hide non-network errors. Consider narrowing to requests.RequestException. Defer to next PR - current fix is improvement over bare except. |
