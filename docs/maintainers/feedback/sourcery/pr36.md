## Individual Comments

## Overall Comments

- The release checklist and summary sections still show `Status: 🔴 Not Started` in some places (e.g., `v0.1.0/checklist.md`), which conflicts with the updated "✅ Released" status elsewhere; consider normalizing the status across all v0.1.0 docs.
- Several checklist items are left as `[ ]` but annotated with "⏭️" or similar notes indicating they were intentionally skipped; if any tooling parses these checkboxes, it might be clearer to use a separate "N/A" or "Skipped" convention instead of leaving them unchecked.
