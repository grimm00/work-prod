### Comment #1

**Location**: `backend/tests/integration/api/test_projects.py:775-779`

**Type**: suggestion (testing)

**Description**: Since the test now verifies that an invalid `status` is ignored and returns a 200 with two projects, also assert that the returned items are specifically `project1` and `project2` (e.g., by ID or name). This guards against cases where the endpoint returns a different set of two projects while still passing the current length check.

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
-        # If returning error, should have error message
-        data = json.loads(response.data)
-        assert &#x27;error&#x27; in data
+    # Invalid status values are ignored, so all projects should be returned
+    assert response.status_code == 200
+    data = json.loads(response.data)
+    assert isinstance(data, list)
+    assert len(data) == 2
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**suggestion (testing):** Strengthen assertions to verify that the returned projects are the ones created in this test

<b>Suggestion</b>

<pre><code>
    # Invalid status values are ignored, so all projects should be returned
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = json.loads(response.data)
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) == 2

    # Ensure that the returned projects are exactly the ones created in this test
    returned_names = {project[&quot;name&quot;] for project in data}
    assert returned_names == {project1.name, project2.name}
</code></pre>

### Comment #2

**Location**: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/projects/fix/pr12/batch-medium-low-01.md:33`

**Type**: nitpick (typo)

**Description**: Please rename this heading to `## Issue Details`, and apply the same wording in the other PR #12 batch files for consistency.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
+
+---
+
+## Issues Details
+
+### Issue PR12-#4: Use Named Expression
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**nitpick (typo):** Section heading `Issues Details` is slightly ungrammatical; `Issue Details` would read more naturally.

### Comment #3

**Location**: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/projects/fix/pr12/batch-low-low-01.md:33`

**Type**: nitpick (typo)

**Description**: Please update this heading to `## Issue Details` and keep it consistent with the corresponding section in the other batch files.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
+
+---
+
+## Issues Details
+
+### Issue PR12-#4: Use Named Expression
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**nitpick (typo):** Heading `Issues Details` is slightly off; `Issue Details` is the more standard phrasing.

<b>Suggestion</b>

<pre><code>
## Issue Details
</code></pre>

### Comment #4

**Location**: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/projects/fix/pr12/batch-medium-medium-01.md:33`

**Type**: nitpick (typo)

**Description**: Using the singular here is more idiomatic for a section heading and better matches common documentation wording.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
+
+---
+
+## Issues Details
+
+### Issue PR12-#4: Use Named Expression
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**nitpick (typo):** Consider adjusting `Issues Details` to `Issue Details` for clearer wording.

## Overall Comments

- In `docs/maintainers/feedback/sourcery/pr12.md`, the priority matrix header still has five columns but the PR12-#3 row now has six (including a status cell), so the header/columns should be updated to align correctly.
- The new `STRUCTURE.md` under `docs/maintainers/planning/features/projects/fix/` is marked as a proposed structure, but much of it is already implemented in this PR; consider updating the status and wording to clearly reflect the current state of the directory layout.
