## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke Documentation

- Each subdirectory has its own README.md hub
- Hub files provide quick links to spoke documents
- Spoke documents focus on single topics
- Progressive disclosure: Overview → Details → Analysis

### Feature-Based Planning

- Features organized under `planning/features/`
- Each feature has hub-and-spoke documentation
- Includes fix directories for troubleshooting
- Status tracking with consistent indicators

### Decision Documentation

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `decisions/`
- Options analysis and rationale
- Historical context preservation
- Lessons learned documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Features

1. Create feature directory: `planning/features/[feature-name]/`
2. Add README.md hub with quick links
3. Create feature-plan.md with overview
4. Add phase documents as needed

### For Releases

1. Create release directory: `planning/releases/vX.Y.Z/`
2. Add checklist.md and release-notes.md
3. Update release history

### For Decisions

1. Create ADR: `decisions/0001-[decision-name].md`
2. Document context, decision, and consequences
3. Link to related planning documents
