## 📋 Overview

This directory manages two types of opportunities:

### Internal Opportunities
**Purpose:** Export learnings FROM work-prod TO other projects
- Insights to share with dev-infra template
- Best practices discovered during implementation
- Documentation patterns that worked well
- Process improvements to propagate

### External Opportunities
**Purpose:** Import knowledge FROM other projects TO work-prod
- Templates and guides from other sources
- Research findings to apply here
- Best practices to adopt
- Integration patterns to consider
