## 🎯 Overview

The planning directory organizes all project planning activities using a hub-and-spoke documentation pattern. Each planning area has its own directory with focused documentation.

### Planning Philosophy

1. **Feature-Based Planning** - Organize work around user-facing features
2. **Hub-and-Spoke Documentation** - Clear entry points with detailed spoke documents
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Overview → Plan → Phases → Analysis
4. **Status Tracking** - Consistent indicators and progress monitoring
5. **Decision Documentation** - Rationale and context preservation
