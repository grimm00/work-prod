## 🎯 Overview

Feature planning organizes development work around user-facing functionality. Each feature has its own directory with hub-and-spoke documentation for clear navigation and focused content.

### Feature Planning Philosophy

1. **User-Centric** - Features solve real user problems
2. **Hub-and-Spoke** - Clear entry points with detailed documentation
3. **Phase-Based** - Break features into manageable phases
4. **Status Tracking** - Consistent progress monitoring
5. **Fix Integration** - Troubleshooting documentation included

### Directory Breakdown

**Root Level (Planning/Coordination):**

- Core planning and coordination files
- Feature plans, phases, status tracking, analysis documents
- "Planning about the work"

**deliverables/ (Planning Outputs):**

- Templates produced from planning (e.g., lesson-template.md, form-template.md)
- Documentation guides created as planning outputs
- User-facing content and guides
- Any artifacts/outputs from the planning process
- **NOT code implementation** (backend/frontend code stays in respective directories)

**fix/ (Troubleshooting):**

- Known issues and solutions
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Error fixes and workarounds

**archived/ (Historical):**

- Superseded planning documents
- Old versions of plans
- Historical reference material

## 🎨 Feature Development Pattern

### 1. Feature Discovery

- Identify user problem or opportunity
- Create feature directory
- Write initial feature-plan.md

### 2. Planning Phase

- Define success criteria
- Break into phases
- Create phase documents
- Set up status tracking

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Execute phases sequentially
- Update status documents
- Document decisions and learnings
- Create fix documentation as needed

### 4. Completion Phase

- Document results and metrics
- Archive superseded documents
- Update project roadmap
- Share lessons learned

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Creating a New Feature

1. **Create Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p features/[feature-name]
   cd features/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Copy Templates**

   - Copy `feature-plan-template.md` → `feature-plan.md`
   - Copy `phase-template.md` → `phase-1.md`
   - Create `README.md` hub

3. **Customize Content**

   - Update feature description and goals
   - Define success criteria
   - Break into phases
   - Set up status tracking

4. **Link to Hub**
   - Add feature to features/README.md
   - Update project roadmap
   - Create initial status document
