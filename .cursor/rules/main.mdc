**Purpose:** Guide AI assistance to align with project best practices and workflow  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-05  
**Status:** ✅ Active

---

## 📋 Quick Links

### Rules Files

- **[Backend Rules](backend.mdc)** - Backend-specific patterns and conventions (when created)
- **[Frontend Rules](frontend.mdc)** - Frontend-specific patterns and conventions (when created)

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a work productivity and engagement management system using:

- **Hub-and-spoke documentation pattern** for organization
- **Feature-based planning** with phased development
- **Git Flow** version control strategy
- **Progressive disclosure** for documentation (Overview → Details → Analysis)
- **Research-driven decisions** with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Technology Stack (Finalized 2025-11-26)

**Backend:**

- Python + Flask (application factory pattern)
- SQLAlchemy ORM + Flask-Migrate
- SQLite (local-first database)

**Frontend:**

- React 18 + Vite build tool
- Zustand (state management)
- React Router v6 (navigation)
- Axios (API client)

**Integration:**

- Separate servers in development (Vite proxy)
- Flask serves React in production

---

## 📁 Documentation Standards

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

**ALWAYS follow this pattern when creating or updating documentation:**

1. **Hub Files (README.md)**

   - Serve as navigation entry points
   - Include "📋 Quick Links" section at the top
   - Provide overview of the directory/feature
   - Link to spoke documents
   - Include status indicators and last updated date

2. **Spoke Documents**

   - Focus on single topics or phases
   - Link back to hub files
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `feature-plan.md`, `phase-1.md`)
   - Include status and date metadata

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with high-level overview
   - Provide links to detailed documents
   - Use clear section hierarchy
   - Avoid overwhelming users with too much detail in hub files

### Status Indicators

Use these **consistently** across all documentation:

- 🔴 **Not Started** - Planning stage only
- 🟡 **Planned** - Approved but not yet begun
- 🟠 **In Progress** - Active development
- ✅ **Active/Complete** - Operational or finished

### Date Format

Always use: `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., 2025-11-26)

### File Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for file names: `feature-plan.md`, `status-and-next-steps.md`
- Use **descriptive names**: `phase-1-foundation.md` not `p1.md`
- README.md files are always **UPPERCASE**

---

## 🔄 Workflow Processes

**Detailed workflow documentation:** See [workflow.mdc](workflow.mdc) for complete workflow processes including:

- Git Flow branching strategy and commit requirements
- Pull Request review workflow and fix management
- Feature planning process and lifecycle
- CI/CD integration and tool configurations

---

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### File Location Rules

1. **Feature Planning** → `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/`
2. **Planning Outputs (Deliverables)** → Within feature directories under `deliverables/`
   - Templates, guides, and documentation produced from planning
   - NOT code implementation (code goes in backend/frontend)
3. **Release Management** → `docs/maintainers/planning/releases/vX.Y.Z/`
4. **Research Documents** → `docs/maintainers/research/[category]/`
   - Category-based organization (tech-stack, microsoft, miro, data-models, etc.)
   - Comprehensive analysis before decisions
5. **Architecture Decisions (ADRs)** → `docs/maintainers/decisions/`
   - Format: `ADR-NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`
   - Concise decision records with rationale
6. **User Documentation** → `docs/` (user-facing guides)
7. **Troubleshooting** → Within feature directories under `fix/`

## 📝 Research & Decision Documentation

### Research-to-Decision Flow

**Flow:** Research → Analysis → Recommendation → ADR (if architectural)

1. **Research Documents** (`docs/maintainers/research/[category]/`)

   - Comprehensive exploration of options
   - Deep analysis (500-700+ lines typical)
   - Multiple alternatives evaluated
   - All findings documented
   - Organized by category (tech-stack, microsoft, data-models, etc.)

2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** (`docs/maintainers/decisions/`)
   - Concise decision summary
   - Links back to supporting research
   - Documents rationale and consequences
   - Captures what was decided and why

### When to Create ADRs

Create ADRs in `docs/maintainers/decisions/` for:

- Technology stack choices (✅ 4 ADRs created for Week 1 tech stack)
- Architecture patterns
- Database schema decisions
- API design approaches
- Security implementations
- Integration strategies

**Do NOT create ADRs for:**

- Implementation details
- Temporary decisions
- Minor refactors
- Non-architectural choices

### ADR Naming and Numbering

- **Format:** `ADR-NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`
- **Numbering:** 4-digit zero-padded sequential (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
- **Never Reuse Numbers:** Even for superseded ADRs
- **Examples:**
  - `ADR-0001-flask-backend-architecture.md`
  - `ADR-0002-react-frontend-architecture.md`
  - `ADR-0003-sqlite-database-design.md`
  - `ADR-0004-flask-react-integration-strategy.md`

### ADR Format

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Supersedes:** [ADR-XXXX] or None
**Superseded By:** [ADR-YYYY] or N/A

## 🎯 AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Suggesting Changes

1. **Respect existing patterns** - Don't introduce new organizational patterns
2. **Update documentation** - When creating features, update relevant hub files
3. **Maintain consistency** - Use established status indicators and date formats
4. **Follow templates** - Use feature plan and phase templates
5. **Link bidirectionally** - Hub → Spoke and Spoke → Hub

### When Creating New Features

1. Create feature directory with all required files
2. Update `docs/maintainers/planning/features/README.md` with new feature link
3. Add entry to project roadmap
4. Use appropriate status indicators
5. Include deliverables/ directory for planning outputs (templates, guides, documentation)
6. Include fix/ directory structure if troubleshooting is expected

### When Making Code Changes

1. Check if documentation needs updating
2. Determine if PR is required (feat/fix) or can push directly (docs/chore)
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Update relevant README files
5. Consider if ADR is needed for significant decisions

### When Handling Fixes

1. **After PR Merge:** Use `/fix-plan` to create fix batches from Sourcery review
2. **Batch Creation:** Group issues by priority/effort, support cross-PR batches
3. **Implementation:** Use `/fix-implement` with TDD workflow
4. **PR Creation:** Use `/pr --fix [batch-name]` for fix PRs
5. **Post-Merge:** Use `/post-pr` to update fix tracking and clean up branches
6. **Fix Tracking:** Use hub-and-spoke organization (`fix/pr##/`, `fix/cross-pr/`)
7. **Review Old Issues:** Use `/fix-review` to identify deferred issues across PRs

**Detailed Workflow:** See [workflow.mdc](workflow.mdc) for complete fix management workflow.

### Response Style

- Be clear and actionable
- Provide rationale for suggestions
- Reference project patterns
- Offer to implement rather than just suggest
- Ask clarifying questions when scope is unclear

### Learning Project Classification

**Critical for MVP:** Learning projects (17 of 59 total projects) require sub-classification:

**Categories:**

- **Work-Related Learning:** Skills for current job, career development, company technologies
- **Personal Development:** Hobbies, non-work skills, academic learning unrelated to work
- **Hybrid:** Projects spanning both work and personal development categories

**Schema Impact:**

- `learning_type` field: `work_related` | `personal_dev` | `hybrid` | `null` (for non-Learning projects)
- `learning_context` text field: free-form description of learning goals
- `learning_status`: `exploring` | `active_learning` | `completed` | `paused`

**UI Impact:**

- Filter projects by learning type in project views
- Display learning badges/tags
- Separate work-related and personal learning metrics

**Metrics Impact:**

- Work-related learning may count toward work project metrics
- Personal development tracked separately
- Hybrid projects appear in both contexts

**Documentation:** See `docs/maintainers/research/data-models/learning-project-taxonomy.md` for detailed taxonomy design.
