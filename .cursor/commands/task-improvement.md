# Task Improvement Command

Use this command to implement CI/CD improvement phase tasks step-by-step, following process/documentation workflow. Focuses on documentation updates, process improvements, and workflow integration rather than code implementation.

---

## Configuration

**Phase Path Detection:**

This command supports CI/CD improvement phase organization:

- **CI/CD Improvement Phases:**
  - Path: `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]/phase-N.md`
  - Improvement name auto-detected from context or configuration
  - Example: `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/status-tracking-automation/phase-1.md`
  - Use `--improvement [name]` option to specify improvement name

**Improvement Detection:**

- Use `--improvement` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect:
  - Check if `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/` exists
  - If multiple improvements exist, search for phase documents in each
  - If single improvement exists, use that improvement name
  - If no improvements exist, prompt user or error

**Phase Structure Support:**

- Numbered phases: `phase-1.md`, `phase-2.md` (default)
- Named phases: `phase-[name].md` (if configured)

**Branch Naming:**

- Default format: `ci/[improvement-name]-phase-N-[description]`
- Examples: `ci/status-tracking-automation-phase-1`, `ci/documentation-validation-phase-2`

**Task Grouping:**

- Default: Related tasks grouped together
- Process/documentation tasks typically standalone
- Group related documentation updates together

---

## Workflow Overview

**Pattern:**
1. Phase has multiple tasks (process/documentation focused)
2. **Task Grouping:** Related tasks grouped together (e.g., all documentation updates for a section)
3. Implement the task group completely
4. Commit the work
5. Stop and wait for user to invoke command again for next task group
6. Create PR only after completing ALL tasks in phase (use `/pr --ci-improvement [name] --phase [N]` command)

**Task Grouping Rules:**

- **Group together:** Related documentation updates (e.g., all updates to one command)
- **Group together:** Related process steps (e.g., all workflow integration steps)
- **Separate:** Different components (e.g., documentation vs. process integration)
- **Separate:** Large/complex tasks that benefit from review

**Examples:**

- Task 1 (Update Command A Documentation) + Task 2 (Update Command B Documentation) = **One invocation** (if related)
- Task 3 (Create Process Guide) = **Separate invocation** (different component)
- Task 4 (Integrate with Workflow) = **Separate invocation** (different component)

**When to create PR:**

- After completing the LAST task in the phase
- Use `/pr --ci-improvement [name] --phase [N]` command for complete PR workflow
- Before marking phase as complete
- After manual verification (if applicable)

**Key Principle:** Group related process/documentation tasks, but separate different components. Complete the task group, commit it, then stop. User will invoke command again for the next task group.

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/task-improvement [phase-number] [task-number] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/task-improvement 1 1` - Implement Phase 1, Tasks 1-2 (related documentation updates)
- `/task-improvement 1 3` - Implement Phase 1, Task 3 (process guide creation)
- `/task-improvement 2 1 --improvement status-tracking-automation` - Specify improvement name
- `/task-improvement 1 1 --improvement documentation-validation` - Different improvement

**Task Grouping:**

- When you specify a task, check if next tasks are related
- Different task types (documentation vs. process) are separate invocations
- Check phase document to identify natural groupings

**Options:**

- `--improvement [name]` - Specify improvement name (overrides auto-detection)

**Important:** 
- This command handles **one task group at a time** (typically related process/documentation tasks)
- After completing a task group, stop and wait for user to invoke again for next group
- Do NOT continue to next task group automatically
- Use `/pr --ci-improvement [name] --phase [N]` command when all tasks are complete to create PR

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Start a Phase Task

**What to do:**

1. **Detect improvement structure:**
   - Use `--improvement` option if provided
   - Otherwise, auto-detect:
     - Check if `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/` exists
     - If multiple improvements exist, search for phase documents in each
     - If single improvement exists, use that improvement name
     - If no improvements exist, prompt user or error

2. **Read the phase document:**
   - CI/CD improvement: `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]/phase-N.md`
   - Support alternative structures: `milestone-N.md`, `sprint-N.md` (if configured)

3. **Identify the current task** (numbered in the document)

4. **Check prerequisites** (previous tasks, phase status)

5. **Create improvement branch if starting phase:**
   - Default: `ci/[improvement-name]-phase-N-[description]`
   - Configurable via project configuration

**Branch naming:**

- First task: `ci/[improvement-name]-phase-N-[description]` (e.g., `ci/status-tracking-automation-phase-1`)
- Subsequent tasks: Use same branch

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Improvement structure detected
- [ ] Phase document read and understood
- [ ] Prerequisites met (previous phase complete)
- [ ] Improvement branch created (if first task)
- [ ] Current task identified and understood

---

### 2. Implement Task Group Following Process/Documentation Workflow

**Process/Documentation Pattern (not TDD):**

**For documentation updates:**

- [ ] Read existing documentation
- [ ] Identify what needs updating
- [ ] Make documentation updates
- [ ] Review for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Commit: `docs(ci/[improvement-name]): update [documentation description]`

**For process improvements:**

- [ ] Review current process
- [ ] Identify improvement needed
- [ ] Document new process
- [ ] Update workflow documentation
- [ ] Test process (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit: `feat(ci/[improvement-name]): improve [process description]`

**For workflow integration:**

- [ ] Review workflow documentation
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Update workflow documentation
- [ ] Update command documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Test integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit: `feat(ci/[improvement-name]): integrate [workflow description]`

**Task-specific patterns:**

**Documentation Updates:**

1. Read existing documentation
2. Identify sections to update
3. Make updates following project style
4. Review for clarity and completeness
5. Verify links work
6. Commit

**Process Documentation:**

1. Review current process
2. Document new/improved process
3. Add examples and best practices
4. Update related documentation
5. Review for completeness
6. Commit

**Workflow Integration:**

1. Review workflow documentation
2. Identify integration points
3. Update workflow steps
4. Update command documentation
5. Add validation steps
6. Commit

---

### 3. Commit Strategy

**Commit after each logical unit:**

**Small commits are better:**

- One commit per documentation section updated
- One commit per process improvement
- One commit per workflow integration

**Commit message format:**

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed

Related: CI Improvement [name], Phase N, Task M
```

**Types:**

- `docs` - Documentation only
- `feat` - New process/improvement
- `refactor` - Process improvement
- `chore` - Maintenance

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "docs(ci/status-tracking-automation): add status update reminders to task-phase command"
git commit -m "feat(ci/status-tracking-automation): integrate status checks into PR workflow"
git commit -m "docs(ci/documentation-validation): create validation checklist template"
```

---

### 4. Check Task Completion

**After implementing a task:**

- [ ] All tasks for this group complete
- [ ] Documentation follows project patterns
- [ ] Links verified (if documentation)
- [ ] Process documented clearly
- [ ] Manual verification done (if applicable)
- [ ] Task checklist items completed
- [ ] Committed to improvement branch

**Update improvement plan:**

- Mark phase status in `improvement-plan.md` if phase complete
- Don't commit improvement plan changes until phase complete

**Improvement plan location:**

- `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]/improvement-plan.md`

---

### 5. Stop After Task Group Completion

**After completing a task group:**

- [ ] Task group fully implemented
- [ ] All commits made to improvement branch
- [ ] Documentation/process verified
- [ ] **STOP - Do NOT proceed to next task group**
- [ ] Present completion summary to user
- [ ] Indicate which tasks were completed (e.g., "Tasks 1-2 complete: Documentation updates")
- [ ] Wait for user to invoke command again for next task group

**Important:** This command handles ONE task group at a time (typically related process/documentation tasks). The user will invoke the command again with the next task number when ready to continue.

---

### 6. Complete All Tasks - Create PR

**When ALL tasks in phase are done:**

**Pre-PR Checklist:**

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Links verified (if documentation)
- [ ] Process documented clearly
- [ ] Manual verification complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Phase document updated (all tasks marked complete)
- [ ] Improvement plan updated (phase status)
- [ ] No linter errors (if applicable)

**Create PR:**

1. Push final commits to improvement branch
2. Run Sourcery review: `dt-review` from dev-toolkit (if available)
3. Fill out priority matrix in `docs/maintainers/feedback/sourcery/pr##.md` (if review available)
4. Address any CRITICAL/HIGH issues before PR
5. Create PR with comprehensive description

**PR Title Format:**

```
ci: [Phase N Description] ([Improvement Name] - Phase N)
```

**PR Description Template:**

```markdown
## CI/CD Improvement: [Improvement Name] - Phase N

[Brief description of what was implemented]

---

## Task Detection Logic

**How to identify tasks:**

Tasks are typically numbered in phase documents:

- `#### 1. Update Command Documentation`
- `#### 2. Create Process Guide`
- `#### 3. Integrate with Workflow`
- etc.

**Task boundaries:**

- Each numbered section is a task
- Tasks may have sub-items (checkboxes)
- Complete all sub-items before moving to next task

**Last task detection:**

- Check if there are more numbered tasks after current
- Look for "Completion Criteria" section (comes after all tasks)
- If no more tasks, it's time to create PR

## Tips

**While implementing:**

- Focus on ONE task group (typically related process/documentation tasks)
- Keep phase document open for reference
- Check off items as you complete them
- Review documentation for clarity
- Verify links work (if documentation)
- Commit frequently (small commits)
- Push to branch regularly

**Task grouping:**

- Related documentation updates naturally belong together
- Complete the full task group before stopping
- Different components (documentation vs. process) are separate

**After completing task group:**

- **STOP - Do NOT continue to next task group**
- Present summary of what was accomplished
- Indicate which tasks were completed (e.g., "Tasks 1-2 complete")
- Wait for user to invoke command again

**Important reminders:**

- One task group per invocation (typically related process/documentation tasks)
- Complete task group fully before stopping
- Don't proceed to next task group automatically
- Use `/pr --ci-improvement [name] --phase [N]` when all tasks done
