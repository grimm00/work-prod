# Reflection Artifacts Command

Extracts structured planning artifacts from reflection documents. Creates feature plans, release checklists, CI/CD improvement plans, and other actionable documents ready for implementation.

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- After creating a reflection document with `/reflect`
- To extract actionable suggestions into structured planning artifacts
- Before planning next stage (feature, release, infrastructure)

**Key principle:** Transform reflection insights into structured, actionable planning artifacts following established templates.

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/reflection-artifacts [reflection-file] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/reflection-artifacts` - Extract artifacts from latest reflection (default)
- `/reflection-artifacts reflection-2025-12-07-mvp-complete.md` - Use specific reflection file
- `/reflection-artifacts --type release` - Only generate release artifacts
- `/reflection-artifacts --type feature` - Only generate feature artifacts
- `/reflection-artifacts --type all` - Generate all artifact types (default)
- `/reflection-artifacts --output-dir releases/v0.1.0` - Custom output directory
- `/reflection-artifacts --dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files
- `/reflection-artifacts --inline` - Execute simple tasks immediately (⚠️ use with caution)

**Options:**

- `--from-reflection FILE` - Specify reflection file (default: latest in reflections/)
- `--type TYPE` - Artifact type to generate (`feature`, `release`, `ci-cd`, `infrastructure`, `all`)
- `--output-dir DIR` - Custom output directory (default: appropriate planning directory)
- `--dry-run` - Show artifact plan without creating files
- `--inline` - Execute simple tasks immediately instead of creating planning artifacts (⚠️ cautionary use)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Reflection File

**Default behavior:**

- Find latest reflection file in `docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/`
- Sort by date (most recent first)
- Use latest reflection file

**Manual specification:**

- Use provided reflection file path
- Verify file exists and is readable

**Commands:**

```bash
# Find latest reflection
ls -t docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-*.md | head -1

# Check if reflection file exists
ls docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-2025-12-07-mvp-complete.md
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Reflection file identified (or using default)
- [ ] File exists and is readable
- [ ] File contains "Actionable Suggestions" section

---

### 2. Parse Reflection Document

**Extract from reflection file:**

- "Actionable Suggestions" section
- "Recommended Next Steps" section
- "Opportunities for Improvement" section
- "Potential Issues" section
- Current state information
- Key metrics

**Parse actionable suggestions:**

- Extract suggestions by priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Categorize by type (feature, release, ci-cd, infrastructure)
- Extract effort estimates
- Extract benefits and next steps

**Example parsing:**

```markdown
### High Priority

#### 1. Create Release Management Structure

**Category:** Release Management  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Effort:** MEDIUM (2-3 hours)

**Suggestion:**
Create release directory structure and templates...

**Next Steps:**

1. Create release directory structure
2. Create release checklist template
   ...
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Reflection document parsed
- [ ] Actionable suggestions extracted
- [ ] Suggestions categorized by type
- [ ] Priority and effort extracted

---

### 3. Categorize Suggestions by Type

**Categorization logic:**

1. **Release Management:**

   - Keywords: "release", "version", "tag", "changelog", "release notes"
   - Examples: "Create release checklist", "Prepare MVP release"

2. **Feature Planning:**

   - Keywords: "feature", "new feature", "implement", "add capability"
   - Examples: "Add new feature", "Implement feature X"

3. **CI/CD Improvements:**

   - Keywords: "ci", "cd", "pipeline", "automation", "deployment"
   - Examples: "Improve CI pipeline", "Add deployment automation"

4. **Infrastructure:**
   - Keywords: "infrastructure", "devops", "monitoring", "logging"
   - Examples: "Set up monitoring", "Improve logging"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Suggestions categorized by type
- [ ] Each suggestion assigned to appropriate category
- [ ] Categories verified

---

### 4. Generate Artifacts by Type

## Common Issues

### Issue: No Reflection File Found

**Solution:**

- Check if reflection file exists
- Verify file path is correct
- May need to run `/reflect` first

### Issue: No Actionable Suggestions

**Solution:**

- Check if reflection contains "Actionable Suggestions" section
- Reflection may need to be updated with suggestions
- May need to run `/reflect` with different options

### Issue: Artifact Type Ambiguous

**Solution:**

- Review suggestion keywords
- Manually categorize if needed
- Use `--type` option to force specific type

### Issue: Directory Already Exists

**Solution:**

- Check if artifacts already exist
- Update existing artifacts if needed
- Use `--output-dir` to specify different location

---

## Tips

### Before Running

- Ensure reflection document is complete
- Verify "Actionable Suggestions" section exists
- Review reflection for clear suggestions

### During Artifact Creation

- Review extracted suggestions for accuracy
- Verify artifact types are correct
- Check that all relevant suggestions are included

### After Artifact Creation

- Review artifacts for completeness
- Update artifacts with additional context if needed
- Use `/transition-plan` to create transition plans from artifacts

---

## Inline Execution Mode (`--inline`)

**⚠️ CAUTIONARY USE:** This flag executes tasks immediately rather than creating planning artifacts. Only use when you are certain:

1. The reflection contains simple, well-defined tasks
2. Tasks have clear scope and low complexity
3. You trust the AI agent to make correct inline decisions
4. Immediate execution is preferred over planning documentation

### When to Use `--inline`

**Good candidates for inline execution:**

| Task Type     | Effort         | Example                              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| File creation | LOW (< 30 min) | Create a status report, add a README |
| Hub updates   | LOW (< 15 min) | Add links to existing hub files      |
| Documentation | LOW (< 30 min) | Document patterns, create examples   |
| Simple fixes  | LOW (< 15 min) | Update dates, fix broken links       |

**Not suitable for inline execution:**

| Task Type              | Reason                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Complex features       | Needs phased planning     |
| Multi-file refactors   | High risk, needs review   |
| Infrastructure changes | Requires careful planning |
| Breaking changes       | Needs migration planning  |

### Inline Decision Criteria

The AI agent will evaluate each suggestion using:

1. **Effort estimate:** LOW (< 30 min) is inline-eligible
2. **Complexity:** Single-file or related-files only
3. **Risk:** No breaking changes, no data migrations
4. **Scope:** Clear and bounded, no dependencies

### Inline Execution Flow

```
1. Parse reflection suggestions
2. For each suggestion:
   - Evaluate inline eligibility
   - If eligible AND --inline flag:
     - Execute immediately
     - Report completion
   - If not eligible:
     - Create planning artifact (normal behavior)
3. Report summary:
   - Tasks executed inline
   - Artifacts created for complex tasks
```

### Example Output with `--inline`

```markdown
## Reflection Artifacts - Inline Mode

**Reflection:** reflection-documentation-structure-2025-12-16.md

### Executed Inline ✅

| Task                 | Status      | Files              |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Create status report | ✅ Complete | status-report.md   |
| Create examples hub  | ✅ Complete | examples/README.md |
| Update planning hub  | ✅ Complete | README.md          |

### Created as Artifacts (Complex)

| Suggestion           | Artifact                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLAlchemy migration | infrastructure/sqlalchemy-migration/improvement-plan.md |

### Summary

- **Inline executed:** 3 tasks
- **Artifacts created:** 1 artifact
- **Skipped:** 0
```

### Safety Guidelines

**Before using `--inline`:**

1. Review the reflection document first
2. Ensure you understand all suggestions
3. Confirm tasks are truly simple
4. Be prepared to revert if needed

**The AI agent will NOT inline:**

- Tasks with unclear scope
- Tasks requiring user decisions
- Tasks with HIGH effort estimates
- Tasks affecting critical paths
- Tasks with potential breaking changes
