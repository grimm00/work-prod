# Decision Command

Make decisions based on research findings. Creates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - one ADR per decision point.

---

## Configuration

**Path Detection:**

This command supports multiple project organization patterns:

1. **Dev-Infra Structure (default):**
   - Decisions: `admin/decisions/[topic]/`
   - Research: `admin/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `admin/research/[topic]/requirements.md`

2. **Template Structure (for generated projects):**
   - Decisions: `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/`
   - Research: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/requirements.md`

3. **Project-Wide Structure:**
   - Decisions: `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/`
   - Research: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/requirements.md`

**Topic Detection:**
- Use `--topic` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect from research source
- Sanitize topic name (kebab-case, no spaces)

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- After research is complete
- When you need to make decisions based on research findings
- To document architecture decisions

**Key principle:** One ADR per decision point. Multiple decisions may be needed for a single topic.

**Workflow:**
```
/decision [topic] --from-research [research-doc]
  → Reads research documents
  → Reads requirements document
  → Identifies decision points
  → Creates ADR for each decision
  → Outputs: ADR documents (one per decision)
```

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/decision [topic] --from-research [research-doc] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/decision auth-system --from-research auth-system/research-summary.md` - Make decisions based on research
- `/decision database-choice --from-research database-choice/research-summary.md --requirements database-choice/requirements.md` - Include requirements
- `/decision --dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files

**Options:**

- `--from-research [research-doc]` - Read research documents (required)
- `--requirements [requirements-doc]` - Read requirements document (optional, auto-detected if exists)
- `--topic [topic]` - Specify topic name (overrides auto-detection)
- `--decision-point [point]` - Create ADR for specific decision point only
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Research Source

**Read research documents:**

1. **Read research summary:**
   - **Dev-Infra:** `admin/research/[topic]/research-summary.md`
   - **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/research-summary.md`
   - Extract key findings and recommendations

2. **Read research documents:**
   - **Dev-Infra:** `admin/research/[topic]/research-*.md`
   - **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/research-*.md`
   - Extract findings and analysis

3. **Read requirements (if exists):**
   - **Dev-Infra:** `admin/research/[topic]/requirements.md`
   - **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/requirements.md`
   - Extract functional and non-functional requirements

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Research summary read
- [ ] Research documents read
- [ ] Requirements document read (if exists)

---

### 2. Identify Decision Points

**Extract decision points from research:**

- What decisions need to be made?
- What alternatives were considered?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What are the constraints?

**For each decision point:**

- Decision question: [What needs to be decided?]
- Alternatives: [What options are available?]
- Criteria: [What criteria will be used?]

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Decision points identified
- [ ] Alternatives identified for each decision
- [ ] Decision criteria identified

---

### 3. Create Decisions Hub

**Location Detection:**

- **Dev-Infra:** `admin/decisions/[topic]/`
- **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/`
- **Project-Wide:** `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/`

**Auto-detection:**
- Check if `admin/decisions/` exists → use dev-infra structure
- Check if `docs/maintainers/decisions/` exists → use template structure
- Otherwise → use project-wide structure

**Directory structure:**

```
decisions/[topic]/
├── README.md                    # Decisions hub
├── adr-001-[decision-1].md      # ADR for decision 1
├── adr-002-[decision-2].md      # ADR for decision 2
└── decisions-summary.md          # Summary of all decisions
```

**Create decisions hub:**

**File:** `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/README.md`
